   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to the application

## üìä Evaluation Criteria

Our AI evaluation system scores prompts across four key dimensions:

### 1. Clarity (1-10)
- **What it measures**: How clearly the prompt communicates its intent
- **Good examples**: Specific language, clear structure, unambiguous instructions
- **Common issues**: Vague language, confusing structure, unclear objectives

### 2. Specificity (1-10)
- **What it measures**: How detailed and precise the requirements are
- **Good examples**: Specific output formats, clear constraints, detailed context
- **Common issues**: Generic requests, missing details, vague requirements

### 3. Task Alignment (1-10)
- **What it measures**: How well the prompt aligns with its intended purpose
- **Good examples**: Appropriate tone, relevant context, suitable complexity
- **Common issues**: Mismatched tone, irrelevant information, inappropriate scope

### 4. Completeness (1-10)
- **What it measures**: Whether all necessary context and constraints are included
- **Good examples**: Complete context, all constraints specified, clear success criteria
- **Common issues**: Missing context, undefined constraints, unclear success metrics
