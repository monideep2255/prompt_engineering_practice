Great\! Based on your idea and using the **FinBuddy PRD format** as a guide, here’s a tailored draft PRD for your project:

---

## **📏 PRD: Prompt Practice Lab – Your AI-Powered Prompt Engineering Coach**

**Version:** Initial Prototype

---

### **1\. 󰧤 Background / Context**

Prompt engineering is rapidly becoming a key skill in leveraging AI effectively — especially with large language models (LLMs). Yet for most users, learning to write effective prompts is inconsistent, vague, and unsupported.

There’s no structured environment where people can **practice writing prompts**, receive **real-time feedback**, and **track their improvement** — the way one might practice coding, math, or writing.

**Prompt Practice Lab** changes that. It’s a personal, interactive tool that helps users improve by:

* Practicing different styles of prompting

* Getting structured, criteria-based feedback

* Learning from examples and expert-derived techniques

Inspired by tools like Replit, podcast content (e.g., Lenny’s and Colin Matthews'), and frameworks like Fullstack Coding Agents, this project is designed to help you *build, reflect, and grow* as a prompt engineer.

---

### **2\. ❗ Problem Statement**

* Users lack structured ways to learn prompt engineering.

* No tools provide immediate, actionable feedback on prompt quality.

* Existing GPT playgrounds offer output, but no skill-building loop.

* There’s no lightweight agent that coaches prompt writing through iteration.

---

### **3\. ✅ Solution Overview**

**Prompt Practice Lab** offers:

* 🔍 **Prompt Evaluation & Feedback**: Rate your prompt based on clarity, specificity, tone, and task alignment.

* 🧠 **Explainability**: See why your prompt was rated the way it was.

* ✏️ **Auto-Improvement Suggestions**: See a revised version of your prompt and learn from it.

* 📚 **Learning Modes**: Practice styles like summarization, instruction, creative writing, system setup, etc.

* 📈 **Progress Tracker**: Log your history, scores, and growth areas.

---

### **4\. 🔧 Feature Development Phases**

✨ **Phase 1: Prompt Practice MVP**

* Prompt input field

* AI-generated evaluation:

  * Rating (Good / Bad / Ugly)

  * Written feedback across 3–5 criteria (e.g., clarity, context, specificity)

* Suggested improvement

* Example prompt mode (pre-seeded tasks)

⚙️ **Phase 2: Prompt Types & Style Mode**

* Choose type of prompt: Instructional, Exploratory, System Prompt, Few-shot

* See examples and practice

* Feedback adapted per style

📡 **Phase 3: RAG-based Feedback Coach**

* Upload YouTube/podcast summaries

* Use Retrieval-Augmented Generation to personalize feedback

* “Learn from Lenny/Colin” mode

🧪 **Phase 4: Eval Agents \+ Progress Dashboard**

* Modular evaluation functions (e.g., toneMatch(), goalClarity())

* Log progress, scores, and tips

* Streaks / “Areas to Improve”

🚀 **Phase 5: Playground Mode**

* Experiment freely

* Try challenges: “Write a prompt that gets the AI to generate a 3-part email”

* User-saved best prompts

---

### **5\. 👥 User Personas / Stories**

🧑‍💻 “As an aspiring PM, I want to learn how to write better prompts so I can build faster with AI.”  
 📝 “As a writer, I want to make my GPT prompts sharper for creative use.”  
 📚 “As a student, I want structured practice to improve prompt quality over time.”  
 🧠 “As a curious learner, I want an app that gives feedback and helps me iterate.”

---

### **6\. 🧠 AI Strategy**

* **System Prompt**: “You are a prompt evaluation agent. Your job is to rate, explain, and improve user prompts.”

* **Few-shot examples** of good/bad prompts (injected into context)

* **Tool-Calling Agents** (Phase 4): Separate tools per eval dimension

* **RAG**: Pull feedback principles from uploaded podcasts and docs

* **Eval Module**: Score clarity, task fit, tone, completeness

* **Optional**: Let users ask, “Why was this rated low?”

---

### **7\. 📈 Success Metrics**

* Prompt score improvement over time

* Repeat usage / practice streaks

* % of users who use “Improve My Prompt” suggestions

* Quiz-style challenge completion rate

* Ratio of user-generated vs example-based prompts

---

### **8\. 🔗 Dependencies / Stack**

* **Frontend**: Replit (React)

* **Backend**: FastAPI

* **LLM**: OpenAI GPT-4

* **RAG Source**: Podcast transcripts, YouTube summaries (stored locally)

* **Database**: SQLite or PostgreSQL for local usage

---

### **9\. 🚣 Next Steps / Roadmap**

1. Finalize evaluation criteria and scoring rubric

2. Build Phase 1 MVP: Prompt input \+ feedback output

3. Add improvement suggestions \+ example mode

4. Integrate user session tracker for prompt history

5. Expand into prompt types, style training, and podcast-sourced RAG
